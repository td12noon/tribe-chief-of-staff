  slackHandles: string[];
  name: string;
  company: string;
  title: string;
  notableFacts: string[];
  aliases: string[];
  confidence: number;
}
```

### Meeting Brief

interface MeetingBrief {
  eventId: string;
  oneLiner: string;
  whyNow: string;
  stakes: string;
  likelyGoal: string;
  toneRecommendation: string;
  provenanceLinks: ProvenanceLink[];
  attendees: Person[];
  generatedAt: Date;
}
```

### Provenance Link
```typescript
interface ProvenanceLink {
  type: 'email' | 'slack' | 'call';
  url: string;
  snippet: string;
  timestamp?: Date;
  confidence: number;
}
```

## Integration Specifications

### Google Calendar API
- **Scopes**: `calendar.readonly`
- **Data**: Event metadata, attendees, time, location
- **Frequency**: Real-time webhooks + daily sync

### LinkedIn API
- **Scopes**: `r_liteprofile`, `r_organization_social`, `r_basicprofile`
- **Data**: Professional profiles, company pages, recent posts, connections
- **Processing**: Extract background, experience, company info, recent activity
- **Enrichment**: Enhance person/company entities with professional context

### Gmail API
- **Scopes**: `gmail.readonly`

- Brief regeneration on demand
- Export/delete personal data

## Performance Requirements

### Target Metrics
- Brief generation: <2s response time
- Daily processing: Complete by 7:00 AM
- Entity resolution: 95% accuracy for email matches
- Provenance retrieval: <500ms per link

### Optimization Strategies
- Pre-compute briefs during off-hours
- Cache entity matches for 24h
- Lazy load provenance content
- CDN for static assets

## Deployment Strategy

### Infrastructure
- **App Server**: Docker containers on ECS/GKE
- **Database**: RDS PostgreSQL with read replicas
- **Cache**: ElastiCache Redis cluster
- **Storage**: S3 for clips and attachments
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch/Datadog

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. GitHub Actions for testing
2. Automated security scanning
3. Staging environment for testing
4. Blue-green deployment for production
5. Database migration scripts

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement exponential backoff, request batching
- **Entity Mismatches**: Start with conservative matching, user feedback loop
- **Data Privacy**: Audit all data access, implement data minimization
- **Integration Failures**: Circuit breakers, graceful degradation

### Business Risks
- **Over-summarization**: Always preserve source links
- **Context Loss**: Include quoted snippets with summaries
- **User Adoption**: Start with power user, iterate based on feedback
- **Scope Creep**: Strict V1 feature freeze after Phase 4
